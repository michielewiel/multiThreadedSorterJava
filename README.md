# Multi-Threaded Sorter for java

The purpose of this program is to determine the best possible sorting algorithm for lists.

This is achieved by trying diffrent lists sorting algorithms and look at the time they needed to sort this.
Applying statistical measurments generates the consisted fastest algorithm for that specific list.

The goal is to also add multiple threads to the sorting algorithms in order to achieve faster results (espeacilly for longer lists).

The project is currently in pre-alpha meaning that I haven't come about to finishing up all the sorting algorithms. Feel free to look at the code and make your own edits. But keep in mind this isn't very readable and needs lots of improvments.

You can keep track of the progress so far in the Issues section of this project or check the commits.
